# schottky-anomaly-filter-method
This project is my final thesis titled 'Estimation of Energy Gap Width in Asymmetric Double Quantum Well Potential Using Schottky Anomaly' and was completed using Python programming language and Filter Method (Nurhuda &amp; Rouf, 2017) to fulfill my undergraduate (S1) studies with a focus on Physics at University of Brawijaya.

# CHANGELOG

## [1.1] - 2/6/2025

### Added
- Saving a file to .dat extension for the partition function, average energy, and heat capacity.
- DATA FUNGSI PARTISI.dat (partition function), DATA ENERGI RATA-RATA.dat (average energy), and DATA KAPASITAS PANAS.dat (heat capacity) for easy plotting partition function, average energy, and heat capacity.
- DATA FUNGSI PARTISI.txt (partition function), DATA ENERGI RATA-RATA.txt (average energy), and DATA KAPASITAS PANAS.txt (heat capacity) for easy opening file.

### Fixed
- Fix typos in the earlier version.
